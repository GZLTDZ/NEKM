**Files and Descriptions**

* **MH\_NEKM.ipynb**: Solves the modified Helmholtz equation using Model1 and Model3.
* **MH\_DeepONet.py**: Trains the DeepONet and applies it to solve the modified Helmholtz equation.
* **list\_f.npy, list\_g.npy, list\_k.npy, list\_u.npy**: Datasets used for training the DeepONet.
* **0816.out**: Log file recording the results of running *MH\_DeepONet.py*.
* **./figures**: Output directory containing figures generated by *MH\_DeepONet.py*.
* **net.pth**: Saved parameters of the trained DeepONet model.

**Alternative Version**

* **MH\_DeepONet\_better.ipynb**: An alternative Jupyter Notebook for training the DeepONet and solving the modified Helmholtz equation. Compared with *MH\_DeepONet.py*, this version differs mainly in the number of model parameters. It involves more extensive parameter tuning and achieves relatively better performance for DeepONet. However, its accuracy remains significantly lower than that of Model1 and Model3.
